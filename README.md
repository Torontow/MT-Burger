## Description 

Hey, burger lover! So, I have a cookbook called "Pornburger" (keep your mind out of the gutter!) which contains all kinds of recipes for interesting burgers I had never imagined. I can't make them all, so this application can help me keep track of some of the ones I would love to try the most, and allow me to check them off once they have been in my belly. You can use it, too, for any burger joint you may have frequented and menus that have made your mouth melt like a gooey glob of gouda.

## Installation

Simply navigate to the url and follow the prompts.

## Usage

When you go to the site, you'll see a field in the middle where you and add what you would like to try. Once you have submitted your choice, it will be added to a menu on the left of the screen where it will be saved for later should you leave and come back to the site. Once you have finally taken the plunge and given that sandwich a savoury sample, click on "Devour it!" and the burger will appear on the right hand side of the screen.

## Contributing

Big kudos to Annie Kwan [https://github.com/akwanmtl](https://github.com/akwanmtl) helped immensely with this project as I was under a deadline and she found (VERY quickly) a tiny error that was causing a major malfunction.

## Tests

There are no included tests for this project. Given that this was my first time working with handlebars.js, I started by creating an index.html to design the view of the site, which I then translated over to the various handlebars files and partials.
